<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  This module has been a significant journey in developing both my technical and reflective abilities as a data analyst working in an aviation maintenance college. I engaged with a range of machine learning algorithms, from regression to clustering and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), while also grappling with legal, ethical, and collaborative aspects of applying machine learning in professional contexts.
</p>
<p>
  Early in the module, the discussion on Industry 4.0 in Unit 1 made me reflect on the growing reliance on digital systems within aviation education. Drawing parallels with the 2023 FAA NOTAM outage, I recognised that centralisation and automation not only improve efficiency but also concentrate risk. This shifted my mindset from viewing systems purely through the lens of productivity to actively considering resilience and contingency planning.
</p>
<p>
  In Unit 3, I explored linear and polynomial regression using the Diabetes dataset. This exercise grounded me in the practicalities of supervised learning and forced me to confront misconceptions I had about model complexity. Unit 6 extended this foundation into unsupervised learning through a K-Means clustering project on the Iris dataset, as well as a group project using Airbnb data for regression and clustering. These projects were pivotal in applying theory to real-world data and working within a team context, with mixed experiences.
</p>
<p>
  Unit 8’s discussion on AI in aviation assessments was particularly close to home, as I reflected on the deployment of large language models (LLMs) in my department and their unexpected shortcomings. Finally, in Unit 11, I independently developed a CNN for object recognition, progressing from a weak baseline model to a tuned architecture and transfer learning using MobileNetV2. This project marked the culmination of the technical learning curve in the module.
</p>

<h3>Feelings</h3>
<p>
  At the start, I felt excited but also slightly apprehensive. While I had prior experience in data analysis, I had not worked deeply with machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning. The Industry 4.0 discussion gave me a sense of the scale and impact of these technologies, but also their fragility. As the module progressed, I experienced moments of both confidence and frustration.
</p>
<p>
  The polynomial regression project felt manageable, but I initially assumed that adding complexity would always lead to better results. Realising this was not the case was humbling, but it clarified concepts that had previously felt abstract. When I moved into clustering, I felt a real sense of curiosity. Seeing the Iris dataset form meaningful groups without labels was surprisingly satisfying and immediately sparked ideas for applying similar techniques to student English proficiency data at my college.
</p>
<p>
  The Airbnb group project was emotionally mixed. I started optimistic, setting up communication channels early and hoping for balanced participation. When most teammates disengaged, I felt frustrated but determined to carry the project through. The CNN project, in contrast, was invigorating. Working alone allowed me to dive deep into the theory, and moments like discovering why the model misclassified yellow trucks as frogs were genuinely fascinating. By the end of the module, my initial apprehension had turned into a more grounded confidence.
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>
  Several aspects of the module worked well. The progressive structure, moving from classical methods to more advanced deep learning, allowed me to build understanding step by step. Each artefact had a clear role: the regression projects gave me a foundation in model fitting and evaluation, clustering introduced unsupervised learning and feature scaling, and CNNs extended this into complex pattern recognition.
</p>
<p>
  My early initiative in the Airbnb group project helped the team deliver a strong analytical output, despite uneven contributions. I explored external datasets, applied log transformations, and used both regression and clustering to derive actionable business insights. The final report received positive feedback on technical analysis and visuals. However, collaboration was weaker than it could have been. My tendency to “rescue” the group meant that some members remained passive, which limited the richness of discussion and the business interpretation of the results.
</p>
<p>
  The CNN project exemplified effective self-directed learning. I invested time in understanding how CNNs learn spatial hierarchies, why transfer learning works, and how augmentation affects robustness. Accuracy gains were clear and evidence-based: from 57% in the baseline CNN to 73% after tuning, and finally 91% using MobileNetV2. This structured approach contrasted with earlier projects where some steps felt more exploratory and less strategic.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most valuable evaluations came from Unit 8, where I analysed the failure of AI question-generation tools in my workplace. This was not a technical failure but a strategic one: AI was used as a replacement rather than an assistant, without proper workflows or boundaries. This reflection sharpened my ability to assess not just whether a model works, but whether its deployment is appropriate in a regulated, high-stakes context.
</p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>
<p>
  Through this module, I have developed a more nuanced understanding of different machine learning techniques and their appropriate use cases. Regression and polynomial regression taught me about bias-variance trade-offs and the ethical implications of working with sensitive data, particularly medical datasets. K-Means clustering clarified how unsupervised methods can reveal structure in data, and I identified a concrete application: grouping 2,000+ foundation students by PET exam component scores to support differentiated language instruction at the college.
</p>
<p>
  The Airbnb project showed me that machine learning is not just about building models, but about integrating multiple data sources, cleaning them effectively, and communicating insights within team dynamics. It also revealed my leadership tendencies and highlighted the need to balance technical responsibility with fostering peer engagement. The AI in assessment reflection reinforced that adopting AI requires critical thinking about limitations, workflows, and human oversight. CNNs and transfer learning demonstrated the power of deep learning for pattern recognition, but also reminded me that such models demand careful tuning and clear performance tracking.
</p>
<p>
  Crucially, I learned to connect academic theory to my workplace context. For example, I can see how clustering could support student services, how regression might help forecast instructor compliance with certification deadlines, and how CNN concepts could eventually support image-based inspection tasks in aviation maintenance training.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  This module has reshaped both my technical skills and professional mindset. Technically, I now have hands-on experience across a spectrum of algorithms, from regression and clustering to CNNs and transfer learning. Reflectively, I’ve become more self-aware of how I learn, collaborate, and lead.
</p>
<p>
  I began the module focused primarily on efficiency and technical correctness. I finish it with a broader perspective that includes resilience, ethics, collaboration, and strategic implementation. I can identify my strengths—such as self-direction, initiative, and analytical clarity—but also my weaknesses, particularly around fostering shared responsibility in team settings.
</p>

<h3>Action Plan</h3>
<p>
  Moving forward, I plan to apply K-Means clustering to our PET exam data to create performance-based student clusters, enabling targeted support streams. I also intend to use regression techniques to build models that forecast exam performance and staff compliance trends, improving planning in the assessment department.
</p>
<p>
  I will advocate for structured AI integration in question development, defining clear boundaries for AI use and embedding quality assurance workflows. I plan to continue exploring CNN architectures such as ResNets and interpretability methods like Grad-CAM, with an eye toward potential future applications in automated inspection or visual assessment.
</p>
<p>
  In collaborative projects, I will set clearer expectations early and support others in tackling technical work, avoiding over-ownership of tasks. This module has not only given me technical tools but also reshaped how I approach machine learning critically, ethically, and strategically within my professional context.
