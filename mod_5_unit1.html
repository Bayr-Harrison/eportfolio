<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
    For this assignment, I contributed to a university discussion on the impact of Industry 4.0 on my sector, aviation education. Drawing from my experience at an aviation maintenance college, I explored how the adoption of centralized learning management systems, digital tracking tools, and compliance platforms has transformed training and oversight. I connected this to a real-world failure outside the reading list — the 2023 FAA NOTAM system outage that grounded over 11,000 flights due to a single corrupted file. My post compared the fragility of such operational systems to the vulnerabilities emerging in our own integrated educational systems, particularly those enhanced with AI. I argued for resilience planning, redundancy, and data validation as essential safeguards.
</p>

<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>
    This task pushed me to think more critically about the flip side of digital transformation in my field. While I have often viewed new systems in terms of efficiency gains and streamlined processes, researching the FAA incident reminded me that centralization and automation can also concentrate risk. The parallels between operational aviation and aviation education became clear — in both contexts, a single point of failure can have widespread consequences. It also made me reflect on my own role as a data analyst, where I often focus on building systems and processes, but less on how they would perform under stress or failure. The assignment reinforced the idea that resilience is as much a design feature as functionality.
</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>
<p>
    In my current role, I can take these lessons and focus more on how our systems would cope if something went wrong. That means making sure there are sensible backup plans in place so we are not left scrambling, and building in simple ways to double-check important data before it is relied on. I also think it is worth setting aside time to test how our processes hold up under pressure, so we can spot and fix weak points early. Most importantly, I want to make resilience part of the conversation from the very beginning when new systems are introduced, rather than leaving it as something to think about later. This way, we can keep improving how we work while still protecting the trust and stability our students and staff rely on.
