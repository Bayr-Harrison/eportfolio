<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
    This activity required me to engage critically with a professional ethics case study from the Association for Computing Machinery, focusing on the Corazón medical implant scenario. In my initial post, I analysed how a vulnerability in a wireless heart-monitoring implant raised ethical, legal, and social concerns, particularly around patient safety and public trust. I applied the ACM Code of Ethics to assess the responsibilities of the computing professionals involved, especially the obligation to avoid harm, ensure robust testing, and act transparently when risks are identified. I also compared these principles to the British Computer Society Code of Conduct, highlighting shared priorities around public interest, professional competence, and integrity. My contribution used academic literature on implantable medical device security to support the argument that ethical decision-making in computing directly affects real-world wellbeing, not just technical performance.
</p>

<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>
    Reflecting on this task made me more aware of how ethical responsibility in computing becomes amplified when systems intersect with healthcare and human life. While I am accustomed to thinking about data quality, system reliability, and compliance in my professional role, this case study reframed those concerns through a more ethical lens. A software flaw in a consumer application may cause inconvenience, but in a medical implant it can cause physical harm or loss of life. The Corazón case highlighted that ethical professionalism is not limited to reacting correctly after an issue is found, but includes anticipating harm during design and testing stages. It also sharpened my understanding of how professional codes such as those from ACM and BCS are not abstract ideals, but practical frameworks that guide decision-making under uncertainty, especially when commercial pressure conflicts with safety.
</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>
<p>
    Going forward, this reflection will influence how I approach system design, analysis, and evaluation in my own work and studies. I intend to place greater emphasis on ethical risk assessment early in the development lifecycle, particularly when dealing with sensitive or high-impact data. This includes questioning assumptions about acceptable risk, encouraging transparency when limitations exist, and recognising when escalation is ethically required rather than optional. Professionally, I now see codes of conduct as tools I can actively rely on when justifying cautious or conservative technical decisions, especially in environments where efficiency or innovation is prioritised. As I continue through the MSc in Data Science, I aim to integrate ethical reasoning alongside technical skill development, ensuring that the systems I help build or analyse serve users responsibly and maintain public trust.
