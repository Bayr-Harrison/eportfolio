  <h2>Reflective Piece: IoT and Big Data (Using Driscoll’s Model)</h2>

  <h3>What?</h3>
  <p>
    As part of my MSc in Data Science, I was tasked with writing an initial post on the university discussion forum. The topic was to critically evaluate the Internet of Things (IoT) using the article by Huxley et al. (2020), highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks, and challenges of large-scale data collection. In my submission, I explored how IoT devices, such as those used in logistics, generate real-time data that can improve decision-making. I also examined the challenges of inconsistent data formats and the ongoing concerns around security, especially with poorly protected consumer devices.
  </p>

  <h3>So what?</h3>
  <p>
    This topic was especially interesting to me because I genuinely enjoy filling my home with smart gadgets. From air conditioners I can control through an app, to smart watches, printers, and motion sensors, I love the convenience and interconnectedness they offer. Naturally, I was excited to explore IoT from a data science perspective. What I hadn’t considered before this assignment was the level of complexity and risk involved. The more I researched, the more I realized that beneath the surface of convenience lies a web of data inconsistency, privacy concerns, and security vulnerabilities.
  </p>

  <h3>Now what?</h3>
  <p>
    After digging deeper, I now have a much clearer understanding of what “Big Data” means in the context of IoT. These devices generate massive amounts of high-velocity and often unstructured data, which presents both exciting possibilities and serious challenges. While I still appreciate the convenience of smart tech, I have become more cautious about how these devices handle data. Going forward, I will be more selective about the smart devices I use, and I will pay closer attention to their privacy settings and security features.
