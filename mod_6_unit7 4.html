<h3>What?</h3>
<p>
    This worksheet focused on applying summary statistics and hypothesis testing concepts in a practical way. The tasks required selecting and carrying out appropriate statistical tests, including paired and independent samples t tests, variance checks, and decisions about one tailed versus two tailed hypotheses. My responses were written directly into the worksheet, which meant I had to commit to specific choices rather than keeping things abstract.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than treating statistical tests as formulas to apply mechanically, the worksheet repeatedly asked why a particular test was suitable and what assumptions needed to hold. This made the exercise feel less like a maths problem and more like structured reasoning with data.
</p>

<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>
    One of the most useful concepts for me was the distinction between paired and independent samples. Several examples involved measuring the same subjects under two conditions, which made the paired t test the correct choice. This connects directly to my own work in the exams department, where I often compare the same group of students across multiple exam attempts or before and after curriculum changes. Treating those observations as independent would inflate variability and weaken conclusions, so seeing this handled explicitly reinforced the importance of matching the test to the data structure.
</p>
<p>
    The discussion around one tailed versus two tailed tests also stood out. The worksheet made it clear that this decision should be driven by the research question, not by the data once results are known. In my professional context, this maps closely to how we frame performance analysis. Sometimes we are genuinely exploring whether two outcomes differ, while other times we are testing whether an intervention improved results. Being clear about that intent upfront helps avoid retrospective justification and makes reporting more defensible.
</p>
<p>
    More broadly, the worksheet highlighted how easy it is to over interpret small differences when working with large datasets. In my role, where thousands of exam records are analysed, statistical significance alone is not enough. The exercise reinforced the need to think about practical significance and context, not just p values, especially when results may influence academic decisions or resource allocation.
</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>
<p>
    Going forward, this worksheet gives me a clearer framework for deciding when statistical testing is appropriate and how to communicate the results responsibly. I am more conscious of checking assumptions, justifying test choices, and being explicit about what question is actually being answered.
</p>
<p>
    In future analysis work, particularly when evaluating trends in exam performance or the impact of curriculum changes, I plan to use these concepts to separate genuine signals from noise. Rather than relying on headline figures, I want to support conclusions with appropriately chosen tests and clear explanations of their limitations. Overall, this exercise helped me move from “running tests” to thinking more carefully about what those tests are really saying and how they should be used.
