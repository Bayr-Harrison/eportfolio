                <h2>Database Design Project: Reflective Piece<br>(Using Gibbs' Reflective Cycle)</h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Artefacts & Submissions Below</p>


                <h3>1. Description</h3>
                <p>
                    This assignment involved designing and documenting a logical database as part of a team, acting as software consultants. The chosen project matched my current professional experience, so I naturally took the lead and carried out most of the technical work, including integrating systems like Retool and Power BI. My colleagues were happy to let me take charge and supported the project direction. Although I expected a high mark, the result was a 60%, which initially surprised me. Upon reviewing the feedback and watching the professor‚Äôs seminar, it became clear that I had misunderstood the core intent of the assignment.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Feelings</h3>
                <p>
                    I felt confident going into the project because I had experience with similar database systems in my workplace. I believed that implementing what I already knew would naturally lead to a strong academic submission. While I was happy to take the lead and shoulder most of the work, I now realise I didn‚Äôt fully empower my teammates. The project felt like a one-person show. After receiving the feedback, my confidence dropped, but I couldn‚Äôt argue with what was said. I focused too much on documenting what I had already built at work and not enough on justifying the design choices academically, which was the true goal of the task.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Evaluation</h3>
                <p>
                    Starting the project early gave me time to build the database model thoroughly and create visuals that I believed clearly represented the design. I maintained communication with my group and encouraged input where possible. I also created a team contract with roles and expectations, which gave us a basic structure and accountability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there were several key issues. I felt a responsibility to ‚Äúprove myself‚Äù to the team that invited me, which made me take on too much. Although well-intentioned, this approach underutilised the talents and perspectives of my peers. Our group discussions lacked real collaboration, with most ideas being my own. This also meant I didn‚Äôt practice how to lead effectively or delegate meaningfully. Most importantly, I misunderstood the assignment‚Äôs focus. Rather than exploring and justifying different database design options, I simply documented what I had already done before. This missed the point entirely.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Reflecting on this experience, I‚Äôve learned that being knowledgeable isn‚Äôt enough in an academic setting. I failed to engage in the level of critical thinking and justification required. I also missed the opportunity to facilitate genuine collaboration within the team. Leadership isn‚Äôt about doing everything myself, it‚Äôs about bringing out the strengths of others. Additionally, I realised the importance of aligning work closely with assignment expectations. Simply translating professional experience into academic output does not guarantee success.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    In future group projects, I need to balance leadership with collaboration. I should listen more, delegate tasks properly, and focus on enabling contributions from others. I now understand the importance to read assignment briefs multiple times throughout an assinemnt to ensure the project aligns with the reqirements and doesn't stray from it as it progresses.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Action Plan</h3>
                <p>
                    Next time, I‚Äôll still start early and use a team contract, but I will provide everyone with clear objectives and space to contribute meaningfully. If I take on a leadership role, I‚Äôll prioritise guidance over control. I‚Äôll also make it a habit to revisit the assignment criteria at every major milestone, ensuring that my work remains focused on the academic goals. Most of all, I‚Äôll remember that teamwork isn‚Äôt just about output, it‚Äôs about shared growth, responsibility, and reflection.
                </p>
