        <h3>What?</h3>
        <p>
          While evaluating the Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) backup system, I learned how it reduces storage needs by rotating daily, weekly, and monthly backups. However, one detail stood out: if even one daily (incremental) backup in the chain is corrupted, the entire restoration process can fail. That risk made me look at backup strategies in a new light.
        </p>

        <h3>So what?</h3>
        <p>
          I’ve always seen backing up as a safety net—something you do to avoid problems if data is lost. But I hadn’t seriously considered what happens if the <em>backup itself</em> is faulty. I now realise that the process of backing up requires just as much care and planning as any other part of the data pipeline. It’s not enough to just “have a backup”; the method, integrity, and recovery process all matter. Backup isn’t a simple checkbox, it’s a critical design decision that needs thoughtful execution.
        </p>

        <h3>Now what?</h3>
        <p>
          In my role, I’m often responsible for setting up basic data infrastructure. Until now, I treated backups as a side task—simple file copies or snapshots. Going forward, I’ll approach backup planning as a <strong>core part of data architecture</strong>. I’ll explore different backup strategies, including rotation systems like GFS, and evaluate them based on not just storage efficiency, but recoverability, resilience, and long-term reliability.
        </p>
