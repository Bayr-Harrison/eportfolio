                <h2>Importance of an MSc in Data Science</h2><br>
                    <br><h3>1 - Description:</h3>
                <p>We were tasked with writing an academic essay on the topic of the benefits of pursuing a Masters Degree in Data Science.
                    The report was to be 700 - 800 words long and required proper use of the Harvard referencing format. We were provided with a week to complete it.</p>
                    <br><h3>2 - Feelings:</h3>
                <p>Initially, I felt somewhat confident as this seemed to be a nice little project to ease us into postgraduate study as well as encourage us to really understand why we were pursuing a degree in this field.
                    However, I was concerned with the fact that I had never used Harvard referencing before nor had written an academic essay. 
                    This, coupled with the fact that I was supposed to be on vacation with my family and wouldn't have much free time also gave me a fair amount of uncertainty as well.
                </p>
                    <br><h3>3 - Evaluation:</h3>
                <p> In the end, I was able to learn Harvard referencing and submit the essay a day earlyier than required even with my lackluster time management. 
                    I passed and the feedback received was decent though I did not received the 'Strong Pass' that I was initially hopping for.</p>
                    <br><h3>4 - Analysis:</h3>
                <p>The Harvard referencing and bibliography proved to be relatively simple to learn with a plethora of sources available online to teach it. 
                    However, the academic nature of the essay proved to be a bit of a challenge as this was not something I had previous experience with. 
                    The previous essays I had written were not academic in tone and so I did struggle with keeping the essay professional but at the same time, exploring my own personal reasons for undertaking this degree.</p>
                    <br><h3>5 - Conclusion</h3>
                <p> All in all, I felt the induction module's project achieved its intended goals. The first being to ensure, both to the University and myself, that I was ready to persue a postgraduate degree and the second to help me clearly understand and write down my reasons for persuing it. </p>
                    <br><h3>6 - Action Plan:</h3>
                <p> Going forward, I intend to further explore academic writing and practice using the porper tone as well as to work on properly deviding my time between family and study to prevent unhealthy overlaps.</p>
